# Changelog

## Unreleased

- `--display kms` drives any connected KMS display, an SPI/I2C panel the
  kernel drives included.
- `ghee displays` lists every card with a connected display.
- `ghee overlay` writes the kernel's setup for a bundled panel: the
  config.txt lines, and the firmware file the overlay names.
- A KMS display blanks and lights through its kernel driver, which takes
  the panel's backlight or its display-off command with it.
- The console takes a host filter list, applied after each scene's own.
- `--size` on a KMS display renders that size and the display scales it
  across the mode, so a scene can shade a quarter of the pixels and fill the
  screen.
- A scene sizes its buffers as a share of the frame: `full`, `half`,
  `quarter`, `eighth`, `sixteenth`, wherever a WxH goes.
- `--demo clocks`: a grid of dials that fits itself to the frame.
- `-- --help` says when a scene was still starting rather than calling it
  pass-through, and `--no-probe` skips the wait.
- Importing ghee no longer reads the installed metadata, which starts every
  Python scene about a second sooner on a Pi Zero.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-08-04

Ported to Rust.

- Any executable is a scene (see `docs/procedural.md` for the wire
  contract).
- The `ghee-render` wheel carries the embedded renderer and the
  procedural-scene shim in one package.
- The deb carries the `ghee` command and the Python package in one, per
  arch.
- `docs/http.md`: the console's HTTP API.
- u8 data arrays.
- `st7789`: 12-bit colour and partial row updates.
- The H264 fanout fails fast to the client.
- `ghee bench`: the benchmark suite, in the binary.
- `golden --dump` writes the frames out.
